Solution 1:
1. Get all coins in an array
2. Sort the array in increasing order of coin denominations
3. Loop over the array:
	- Find sum of money of each denomination
	- Keep updating the global sum

TC: n + nlogn + n, total nlogn
SC: n

Solution 2:
1. Keep 4 buckets to store number of coins of each denomination
2. Loop over the buckets array
3. Find total sum

TC: n + n, total n
SC: constant
